# DicewarePasswordMaker
Small Python script for creating Diceware-based passwords

# Requirements
This file requires a Python installation and very basic command line skills. I suspect this won't be a problem if you are getting this from git

# Use
Clone or download the repository to your local machine. Run the main file with the command: python diceware.py

It will prompt you for how many words you want in your password. There is no maximum or minimum built in, but the minimally recommended is 5.

The result will be your number of words separated by a randomly chosen (from a list) deliminator. This addition of a special character adds to the passwords complexity. You may add capital letters if you desire even more complexity
